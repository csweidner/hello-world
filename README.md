CSCI E-12 assignment
After teaching at Lake Forest College for twenty+ years, I am now a semi-retired history professor pivoting toward the digital humanities.  CSCI E-12 is my last HES certificate course and was probably my most challenging! I learned a lot, and will continue to build out my website next semester.  #historymatters
